# Zero-Shot Intent Classifier

This sort of thing used to be non-trivial. I hacked this together probably in like an hour. 

Ho boy, the times: they are a changin.

## Setup

1. `git clone <this repo>; cd <this repo>`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a file named `.env` containing one line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`, replacing `...` with your key.
4. `python main.py "becca, play kexp"`
